<!-- Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.

- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.
- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.

Importantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a "hybrid" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others. -->

This can be a crippling emotion in the worse of cases and motivational at it's best. **What is imposter syndrome?** This is the feeling that you aren't worthy of of a position or title. This can be a difficult thing to over-come and almost every day is different. In software development one day you can feel like a god for compelting a project thought to be impossible or extremely difficult and the next feel ashamed for having to look up basic syntax to write a for loop. **Why does this happen?** This happens because of a disparity between our eyes and our hands or in other words the level of skill we can see in others vs our own perceived capability. The same things happen with our facebook feeds, think about it, you only see the best of other's lives and what they want to share with the world. You aren't seeing that [insert friend name here] also has depression or is dealing with a difficult circumstance and it can make you feel like your life is just all wrong but **What can you do about it?** 
## Three steps to recover
- STOP, take a minute to reflect on where you started and how far you've come.
- DON'T, put all preconceived notions of how something is going to go out of your midn and realize that the people you are aspiring to started exactly where you are.
- DO, get excited that your idols aren't special and just start putting the work in. one. day. at. a. time.
